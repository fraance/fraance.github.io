                        Service Users</strong> and giving Catch22 actionable, data-driven insights that align
                    with <strong>Ministry of Justice standards</strong>. This innovative approach values
                    <strong>incremental progress</strong> to build trust, foster agency, and support successful
                    reintegration.

                <h3>Learnings </h3>
                <p>I learned the immense value of listening to diverse voices. By engaging stakeholders -
                    from
                    individuals on probation to senior management - uncovering critical user needs that
                    often
                    went unheard.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>

                <p>Think back to a recent challenge you faced. Maybe you lost a loved one, or had a tough
                    time
                    in a relationship - think of a moment that truly tested you. Now, think about how you
                    overcame it, and how you progressed.

                    You know you're doing better now, but how would you prove it? How would you quantify it?
                </p>

                <p>A prison sentence is usually served in 2 parts - One in prison, and the other on
                    probation.
                    To ensure smooth reintegration into society during probation, the Ministry of Justice
                    contracts various organizations in areas such as Employment, Health, Finance and
                    Wellbeing
                    to help offenders with the transition. </p>

                <p>One of these contracted organisations is Catch 22, who have a Personal Wellbeing Service
                    that
                    works towards supporting community integration and wellbeing of People on Probation.
                    However, to secure and maintain their contract, Catch 22 must show evidence of the
                    impact
                    their service has on its users by quantifying the Service User's progress</p>

                <p>Within Catch-22's Personal Wellbeing Service- Service Users answered a set of questions
                    in
                    their first session, giving them an initial score. In their last session, they answered
                    the
                    same questions to get a final score. The difference between these scores quantifies
                    their
                    progress.</p>

                <p>We started our research with Practitioners to understand their relationship with the tool
                    and
                    observed a lot of friction and annoyance. While a lot of the frustrations were around
                    the
                    app and tech just not working, some deeper frustrations stood out for us.</p>

                <p>Let's go back to the recent challenge you faced. Consider the journey of overcoming that
                    obstacle. You may have had turning points, but the real progress was in the subtle
                    shifts.
                    Similarly, we looked for signs. Tiny, overlooked, seemingly insignificant signs that are
                    your daily, small wins. Because you know you can't go from 0-100 overnight. And this was
                    the basis of our hypothesis.</p>

                <h3>Tool Design</h3>
                <p>
                    To effectively measure incremental progress for Service Users, our design approach began
                    with crucial inquiries to
                    define the most suitable medium, engagement level, and measurement frequency for the
                    tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a co-creation workshop with practitioners, we established that the tool would
                    primarily operate on a laptop for
                    quick and accurate data collection, with a paper-based alternative available for
                    environments like prisons or probation
                    offices where connectivity may be limited. To build trust and foster agency among
                    Service Users, the documentation
                    process was designed to be collaborative, with practitioners holding the final
                    interpretive role to ensure accuracy
                    and relevance. </p>

                </div>

                <p> So, we created our preliminary tool which allows the practitioner to document and keep
                    track of all the micro-action that the service users were exhibiting. Consequently, they
                    can relate each micro-action to the severity of the action, and the area of growth that
                    it contributes to.

                    data would help practitioners score different growth categories in a single session.
                    This iteration would thus fit seamlessly into the practitioner's existing workflow. </p>

                <p> Our Theory of Change envisions a compassionate and informed Justice System where

                    Catch22's
                    refined tool, we aim to capture small, meaningful "Micro-Achievements" that reflect

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This framework provides a structured way to capture,
                    assess, and
                    report on incremental progress. By moving from broad outcomes to specific,
                    observable
                    micro-behaviors, Catch 22's tool can demonstrate meaningful, data-driven progress in
                    Service
                    Users' reintegration journeys, meeting MoJ's standards and building a more holistic

                <p> While we are keen on optimising the tool for Catch 22, one of our biggest stakeholders
                    are the MoJ, as they are the final recipients of the data generated from our tool.

                    Therefore, our final assumption to test is whether MOJ sees this data format as a
                    reliable means of measuring early indicators of long-term progress.
                    To test this assumption, we reached out to a representative from MoJ to get their
                    thoughts on a fictional report.

                    The report showcased the number of users who have made progress, and secondly highlight
                    the advancements achieved by SU through the service, categorised by the specific
                    pathways and outcomes they were referred for, as well as a deep dive into how the
                    progress is measured individually.

                    Through this conversation, we got critical feedback validating our approach.</p>
