                    <p>Catch22 asked the Royal College of Art to help them improve their impact tool measuring the
                        distance traveled for prison leavers. The project aimed to capture and quantify the progress
                        of Service Users in the Personal Wellbeing Service, co-creating a meaningful assessment tool
                        that moves beyond traditional scoring methods.</p>

                    <p>I learned the immense value of listening to diverse voices. By engaging stakeholders - from
                        individuals on probation to senior management - uncovering critical user needs that often
                        went unheard.</p>

                    <p>Think back to a recent challenge you faced. Maybe you lost a loved one, or had a tough time
                        in a relationship - think of a moment that truly tested you. Now, think about how you
                        overcame it, and how you progressed.

                        You know you're doing better now, but how would you prove it? How would you quantify it?</p>

                    <p>A prison sentence is usually served in 2 parts - One in prison, and the other on probation.
                        To ensure smooth reintegration into society during probation, the Ministry of Justice
                        contracts various organizations in areas such as Employment, Health, Finance and Wellbeing
                        to help offenders with the transition. </p>
                    <p>One of these contracted organisations is Catch 22, who have a Personal Wellbeing Service that
                        works towards supporting community integration and wellbeing of People on Probation.
                        However, to secure and maintain their contract, Catch 22 must show evidence of the impact
                        their service has on its users by quantifying the Service User's progress</p>

                    <p>Within Catch-22's Personal Wellbeing Service- Service Users answered a set of questions in
                        their first session, giving them an initial score. In their last session, they answered the
                        same questions to get a final score. The difference between these scores quantifies their
                        progress.</p>

                        shifts.
                        Similarly, we looked for signs. Tiny, overlooked, seemingly insignificant signs that are
                        your daily, small wins. Because you know you can't go from 0-100 overnight. And this was

                        users.

                        eg "He showed up for the session"</p>


                    <p>The theory was validated and we created a way to document the signs.</p>

                    <h3>Tool Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        To effectively measure incremental progress for Service Users, our design approach began
                        with crucial inquiries to
                        define the most suitable medium, engagement level, and measurement frequency for the
                        tool.

                    <p>
                        In a co-creation workshop with practitioners, we established that the tool would
                        primarily operate on a laptop for
                        quick and accurate data collection, with a paper-based alternative available for
                        environments like prisons or probation
                        offices where connectivity may be limited. To build trust and foster agency among
                        Service Users, the documentation
                        process was designed to be collaborative, with practitioners holding the final
                        interpretive role to ensure accuracy
                        and relevance.

                    <div style="padding: 60px; background: #ffffff">
                        <div class="container-xl" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                            <img class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 90%; margin: auto;"

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p> So, we created our preliminary tool which allows the practitioner to document and keep
                        track of all the micro-action that the service users were exhibiting. Consequently, they
                        can relate each micro-action to the severity of the action, and the area of growth that
                        it contributes to. </p>

                    <p> We looked to reshape our tool in a way that blends behavioural observations with the
                        overall feeling of the session.To achieve this, we decided to leverage the case notes
                        that practitioners submitted to the HMPPS website after every session. We believe this
                        data would help practitioners score different growth categories in a single session.
                        This iteration would thus fit seamlessly into the practitioner's existing workflow. </p>

                    <p> While we are keen on optimising the tool for Catch 22, one of our biggest stakeholders
                        are the MoJ, as they are the final recipients of the data generated from our tool.

                        Therefore, our final assumption to test is whether MOJ sees this data format as a
                        reliable means of measuring early indicators of long-term progress.
                        To test this assumption, we reached out to a representative from MoJ to get their
                        thoughts on a fictional report.

                        The report showcased the number of users who have made progress, and secondly highlight
                        the advancements achieved by SU through the service, categorised by the specific
                        pathways and outcomes they were referred for, as well as a deep dive into how the
                        progress is measured individually.

                        Through this conversation, we got critical feedback validating our approach.</p>
