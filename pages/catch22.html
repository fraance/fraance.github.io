                    <p>Catch22 asked the Royal College of Art to help them improve their impact tool measuring the distance traveled for prison leavers. The project aimed to capture and quantify the progress of Service Users in the Personal Wellbeing Service, co-creating a meaningful assessment tool that moves beyond traditional scoring methods.</p>

                    <p>As an equal member of the design team, I contributed to co-designing the theory of change and co-creating an Excel-based tool alongside Catch22 wellbeing practitioners. My responsibilities included gathering insights from practitioners and service users, identifying key challenges, and validating our design hypotheses to ensure the tool’s relevance and effectiveness.</p>

                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <p>This project deepened my understanding of designing for social impact in complex environments. I learned the importance of <strong>trust-building</strong> and even if I had a good idea of what prototyping means, decomposing a theory and testing assumptions was a very valuable method to add to my design toolkit.

                    <h3>Chapter 1: The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Think back to a recent challenge you faced. Maybe you lost a loved one, or had a tough time in a relationship - think of a moment that truly tested you. Now, think about how you overcame it, and how you progressed.

You know you're doing better now, but how would you prove it? How would you quantify it?</p>
