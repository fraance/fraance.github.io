                    <h3>Project Background</h3>
                    <p>Catch22 partnered with the Royal College of Art (RCA) in October 2023 to create an alternative impact tool measuring the distance traveled for prison leavers. The project aimed to capture and quantify the progress of Service Users in the Personal Wellbeing Service, co-creating a meaningful assessment tool that moves beyond traditional scoring methods.</p>

                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <p>This project deepened my understanding of designing for social impact in complex environments. I learned the value of small, measurable progress markers for individuals on probation and the importance of trust-building through tools that genuinely capture their journey. This experience underscored the need for adaptable solutions that resonate with both service users and practitioners, ensuring meaningful data collection that benefits all stakeholders.</p>
