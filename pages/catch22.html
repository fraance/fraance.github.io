                    <p>Catch22 asked the Royal College of Art to help them improve their impact tool measuring the distance traveled for prison leavers. The project aimed to capture and quantify the progress of Service Users in the Personal Wellbeing Service, co-creating a meaningful assessment tool that moves beyond traditional scoring methods.</p>

                    <p>Methodology</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 1: The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Think back to a recent challenge you faced. Maybe you lost a loved one, or had a tough time in a relationship - think of a moment that truly tested you. Now, think about how you overcame it, and how you progressed.

You know you're doing better now, but how would you prove it? How would you quantify it?</p>

                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/3.png" alt="Image 3">
                    <h3>Chapter 2: The Current System</h3>
<p>A prison sentence is usually served in 2 parts - One in prison, and the other on probation. To ensure smooth reintegration into society during probation, the Ministry of Justice contracts various organizations in areas such as Employment, Health, Finance and Wellbeing to help offenders with the transition. </p>
                   
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/4.png" alt="Image 4">
                    <p>One of these contracted organisations is Catch 22, who have a Personal Wellbeing Service that works towards supporting community integration and wellbeing of People on Probation. However, to secure and maintain their contract, Catch 22 must show evidence of the impact their service has on its users by quantifying the Service User's progress</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/5.png" alt="Image 5">
                    <p>Within Catch-22's Personal Wellbeing Service- Service Users answered a set of questions in their first session, giving them an initial score. In their last session, they answered the same questions to get a final score. The difference between these scores quantifies their progress.</p>
                
                   
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/6.png" alt="Image 6">
                    <p>The tool they use to do this has 3 key elements.

                        1) Defined Outcomes: These are goals set by MoJ that Service Users are referred for. 
                        
                        2) Evaluation Statements: These are statements Catch 22 has designed to meet the defined outcomes. But, these are lengthy, complex and vague and require high levels of self-awareness for accurate answers. 
                        
                        3) The Service User then scores themselves on a scale of 0-10 on how much they agree with the statement or not. But this eventually only gives Catch a singular number that doesn't mean much on its own. 
                        
                        </p>

                    <p>We started our research with Practitioners to understand their relationship with the tool and observed a lot of friction and annoyance. While a lot of the frustrations were around the app and tech just not working, some deeper frustrations stood out for us.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I know they've progressed - I can see it! Why do I need a tool?</li>
                        <li>They just score themselves to get done with it - it's not helping</li>
                        <li>Progress is subjective and contextual, every user is different!</li>
                        <li>You can't put a number to people..</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These conversations helped us define our key stakeholders and understand their frustrations.</p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/12.png" alt="Image 12">
                    <p>This further helped us define the key problem areas of the tool.</p>

                    <p>While all of these seemed important, what stood out the most for us was the Parameters</p>

                    <p>And what essentially this question question: - What does progress really look like?</p>

                    <p>And, if you think about it, here's what they were really saying </p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/16.png" alt="Image 16">
                    <p>Confidence, Resilience, Self awareness, Initiative, Commitment,Communication: this is what progress should be measured by. And it's never going to look the same for everyone. </p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/17.png" alt="Image 17">
                    <p>Let's go back to the recent challenge you faced. Consider the journey of overcoming that obstacle. You may have had turning points, but the real progress was in the subtle shifts.
                        Similarly, we looked for signs. Tiny, overlooked, seemingly insignificant signs that are your daily, small wins. Because you know you can't go from 0-100 overnight. And this was the basis of our hypothesis.</p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/18.png" alt="Image 18">
                    <p>We conducted a co-creation workshops with practitioners to validate this hypothesis, and Practioners shared a long list of small wins that they had noticed in their past service users 

                        These were seemingly insignificant signs like 
                        
                        "He showed up for the session" or "He told me, let's have the session in the morning" 
                        
                        But for them, it meant more confidence and initiative. 
                        
                     The theory was validated and we created a way to document the signs.</p>

                    <p>The tool should definitely be on a laptop, for quick and efficient collection of data. But we do need to keep in mind, that certain sessions are held in prisons and probation offices where there is limited connectivity, so a paper-based alternative must be available with an efficient method of data transfer

                        In order to give service users more agency and build trust, it's important that majority of the documentation is done in a collaborative manner, however it is important to notice that the practitioners are experts in the field and therefore should have a final say on what the answers truly mean.
                        
                        To make it more of an acknowledgement session vs assessment, both stakeholders felt that the optimal frequency of documenting should be every 3 sessions
                        
                        What was most encouraging for us through our workshop was that practitioners did the self reflection exercises with the service users anyway, only in an unstructured and undocumented manner
                        </p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/23.png" alt="Image 23">
                    <p>Through these workshops we were able to formalise our prototypes.

                        The tool would be broken into two parts- 
                        
                        First would be a collaborative exercise with the service user and the practitioner where each would discuss any small wins or setbacks that the service user had had in the past few weeks.
                        They would also rate these as high medium low, to have relativity and scale.
                        
                        They would then document them together, either on a laptop or on a paper based form.</p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/24.png" alt="Image 24">
                    <p>This exercise is important from the SUs perspective for three reasons-
                        - it builds trust and transparency in the practitioner and the service
                        - it empowers self reflection and critical thinking
                        - and it gives them agency, something they've rarely had before</p>
                
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraance/portfolio-assets/refs/heads/main/catch22/25.png" alt="Image 25">
                    <p>The second part of the tool is fairly simple

                        Once the service user has left the session- the practitioner chooses the most relevant progress markers for those micro- actions, based on their judgement.
                        
                        And each would be scored according to the scale marked previously.

                    <p> By measuring these different progress trackers throughout different sessions allows for granular measurement of the different progress trackers over time. 

                    Moreover, it allows for the creation of a comprehensive Service User profile, which also can be shown throughout the time of the service. </p>
