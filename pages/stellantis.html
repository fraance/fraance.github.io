          <h1><span>What I have learned</span></h1>
          <p>
            As an apprentice at Stellantis, I gained a wealth of knowledge and
            experience in UX and UI design. Some of the key things I learned
            during my apprenticeship include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I improved my understanding of the UX design process, including
              the importance of exploring, prototyping, testing, iterating, and
              delivering high-quality designs.
            </li>
            <li>
              I developed my skills in working with complex design systems,
              including proficiency in typography, desktop/mobile UI, color,
              layout, iconography, and aesthetic sense. I also learned how to
              create responsive designs that work well across different
              languages and devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              I learned the value of sharing my work early and often with a wide
              range of people, including colleagues, stakeholders, and users.
              This helped me to get feedback and refine my designs in the right
              direction.
            </li>
            <li>
              I learned how to effectively communicate with cross-functional
              teams and stakeholders, and the importance of keeping them engaged
              throughout the design process. This helped me to create designs
              that were coherent, credible, and useful to all parties involved.
            </li>
            <li>
              I had the opportunity to work in a complex, cross-disciplinary
              team, where I learned how to collaborate effectively with people
              from different backgrounds and specialties. This helped me to
              develop my skills in communication, problem-solving, and
              team-building.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, my apprenticeship at Stellantis was a valuable and
            enriching experience that helped me grow as a designer and a
            professional. I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned from
            experienced colleagues and to have contributed to the success of the
            company.
