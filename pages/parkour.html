        <h1><span>The problem</span></h1>
        <p>
          TDN, “Traceur de Nantes” is a French club that proposes Freerunning
          courses and workshops to beginners as well as to confirmed
          practitioners. The objective of the club is to promote and spread
          the practice of this urban sport. As the club develops, the volume
          of its activities grows, the courses multiply and the audience is
          diversifying. So, we took this opportunity to work on a new visual
          identity and a redesign of the site to cope with those new
          challenges.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h1><span>The solution</span></h1>
        <p>
          We worked on improving accessibility and registration, thus gaining
          in efficiency for the user. We worked on creating dynamism for youth while inspiring trust and safety for parents.

        <h1><span>The process</span></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We set off a sociological and anthropological research to
            understand Parkour's community and association in order to create
            the new website in accordance with its values, history, objectives
            and members.
          </li>
          <li>
            We experimented on various media and with different techniques to
            chose visual working axes to tend to a visual identity
            corresponding with the discipline's and association's values.
          </li>
          <li>
            We followed a methodical approach, user scenarios, site map,
            wireframe to create a functional prototype of the new website.
          </li>
          <li>
            We tested the website's prototype with an eye tracking system to
            make a test analysis in order to improve the interface.

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            We set up several methods of approaching the parkour domain. On
            the one hand we conducted research about parkour's history,
            social, legal and existential ecosystem. On the other hand we had
            exchanges with traceurs which allowed us to better understand the
            art, its own codes and values.

          <h2>Parkour's Fact</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Where and why?<br />
              The course was born in the Parisian suburbs, more precisely in
              Evry, in the 1980s. It is the investment of public spaces, the
              reflection of the marginalization of the suburban populations.
              Parkour enthusiasts, through their practice, reclaim the entire
              urban space.
            </li>

            <li>
              Who?<br />
              David Belle is acknowledged as the inventor of parkour and
              founded an original and official group of parkour practitioners
              called Yamakasi. One day when David Belle was on a film set, he
              showed his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé, who suggested
              to change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was more
              dynamic and stronger, and to remove the silent "s" for the same
              reason. Belle liked the idea and officially changed the name of
              his discipline to "parkour”.
            </li>
            <li>What?<br /></li>
            Parkour is an athletic training discipline, it promotes not only
            the discipline of the body, the value of training, the importance
            of a healthy lifestyle but also respect for the instructor and
            others.
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Analysis of the current / quantitative data</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If we estimate the total French community at about 2,000 - 2,500
              practitioners, parkour although constantly increasing, remains a
              niche sport.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parkour is still practiced today by an essentially male public,
              since 85% of French practitioners are men according to the
              French Parkour Federation in 2018.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most of the practitioners are teenagers and young adults, mostly
              aged between 15 and 25, with a few in their 40s.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Qualitative data</h2>
          <p>
            We met up with traceurs and were able to participate in a training
            session and interact with them, it allowed us to get spontaneous
            answers to our questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also sent e-mails to a large number of parkour associations and
            had the opportunity to discuss with one of the leaders of the
            freestreet parkour association by phone which allowed us to
            understand the main characteristics of the discipline, as well as
            quantitative data, number of members, age, range, share of men and
            women of each association.
          </p>
          <p>I selected questions that we asked frequently:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“What are the values of Parkour according to you?”</li>
            <li>“Can you describe a typical training?”</li>
            <li>“Why do new members start parkour?”</li>
            <li>“What are the prejudices you are confronted with?”</li>
            <li>“How many participants do you have in your association?”</li>
            <li>
              “What is the proportion of men and women practicing parkour in
              your club?”
            </li>
            <li>“What are the most popular places for a parkour session?”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>What we learned</h2>
          <p>
            Our research enabled us to confirm the values that we had
            identified, which are the following: knowledge and surpassing
            oneself, solidarity, adaptability to the environment,
            open-mindedness, curiosity and creativity. Parkour is a practice
            with few constraints because parkourers have a flexible schedule
            and the places of expression are multiple. It is recognized as a
            physical activity and not as a sport in France and the authorities
            are rather tolerant when it comes to the public domain because of
            the free appropriation of urban spaces.

              TDN trains all ages (11 years old to adults ) but the club would
              like to attract more girls and women.
            </li>

          <h2>The competition</h2>
          <p>
            Traceur de Nantes has one main competitor, the only other Nantes
            Parkour's club which is “Art Du Déplacement Academy Nantes”: the
            diffrence between the two is that TDN is younger and smaller but
            it has a proximity with trainers compared to “Art Du Déplacement
            Academy Nantes”, which also is more expensive. <br />
            Other competitors are skate and climbing clubs. The avantage of
            climbing clubs is that they are more inclusive.

        <h1><span>Visual identity</span></h1>
        <p>
          With our previous research we were able to establish the challenges
          of the visual identity:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Take into account the rebellious spirit behind Parkour and inspire
            trust for parents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be playful, convivial and open but convey the seriousness of the
            structure in particular the fact that learning is done in optimal
            safety conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./assets/image04_tramegraphique_parkour_portfolio.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          We set up a plastic device with collage, paint, tape, transparency,
          keywords, photography (We went where the club is training to collect
          experimental photos of the site like graffiti, street and buldings)
          to explore graphical tracks. We worked with the value of the
          discipline in particular movement, displacement and freedom. Also,
          we took into account the urban, "street" roots without being limited
          to them. Then, we were able to make a graphical charter and a logo.

        <p>
          Parkour being an art of movement we took this opportunity to
          conceive the logo in a generative way.

        <h1>Setting up the structure</h1>
        <p>
          First of all we highlighted the current websites positive and
          negative points, for example one of the main points was the
          disjointed categories leading to scattered info. After that, we made
          a site map. Then, we went through a few rounds of iteration using
          hand sketching.<br />
          We also came up with a revised and simplified information
          architecture that focused on presentation of the club, registration
          and easy management of accounts.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/image08-sitemap_parkour_portfolio.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          While working on simplifying registration we divided it into two
          parts. For a new trainee, firstly they have to choose training type
          and fill in important information, proceed to payment and then
          secondly they can create an account on the website.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/image09_registartionstep_parkour_portfolio.gif" alt="" />
        <p>
          Our solution is based on two propositions. <br /><br />First, the
          redesign of the site in order to improve referencing, accessibility
          and simplicity of registration, thus gaining in efficiency for the
          user. <br /><br />Then in a second step, the redesign of the graphic
          charter in order to improve visibility and dynamism which makes it
          possible to gain the confidence and desire of the user. As part of
          making the site more accessible, we allow easy and fast registration
          of members, with registration that takes place through an online
          form to fill out. Also, users will have a page where they can manage
          their data and ask questions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h1><span>Eye tracking</span></h1>
        <p>
          We added graphic elements in a similar style to maintain a cohesive
          treatment across the site's elements. We organized the page so the
          user could have access to all important information within the first
          scroll.

          <p>
            We made a call to action yellow on a blue background with an dark
            hover which makes it stand out so that the user knows what to do
            and where to go next. This eliminates confusion and allows the
            website visitors to take the appropriate next steps to subscribe.

          <h2>Subscribe journey</h2>
          <p>
            For the subscribed part, we wanted it to be an easy to use
            interface design so we anticipated the user journey. For example:
            we inform the user of what is absolutely necessary to complete the
            membership at the beginning of the form and we made the
            possibility for both the parent and the future traceurs to
            subscribe in one go. Also, we made sure to make the graphic design
            simple. This allowed users to easily check what they need and what
            they are asked, making their journey throughout subscribing
            trouble-free and smooth.

        <h1><span>Final design</span></h1>
        <p>
          As designers, we pre-process the page for users, organizing and
          prioritizing content in a way that users can grasp almost instantly,
          but there are always things that we don’t anticipate and even more
          as a student. So, we conducted an eye tracking test to find out the
          pain points of our interface allowing us to afterwards improve the
          user experience of our website.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We set the user in front of our website and we followed a design
            interview protocol leading to the user to subscribe:
            <a>check it here.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Then we made them fill out a satisfaction survey in order to
            collect their feelings about their experience:<a>
              you can check it out here.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, we met with each of them to have a discussion allowing us
            to gauge feelings that maybe the survey didn’t catch.

              with a real clarity and good hierarchy of information.The design
              and visual identity of the site is the preferred aspect of 4 out
              of 6 users, with others being its ergonomics and its ease of
              navigation.

          <h2>Improvements</h2>
          <p>
            This work highlighted important improvements to make in order to
            create a better user experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Possibility of going back, which wasn't present in our site,
              unless you click on the logo, but only takes us back to the
              homepage (we improved it).
            </li>
            <li>
              Possibility to modify one last time the information just before
              making the payment.
            </li>
            <li>Modification of the selected fields buttons.</li>
            <li>
              Improvement of the visual for the Facebook post-sponsored, with
              the name of the "Traceurs of Nantes" for a more efficient
              visibility and a better understanding at first glance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add an icon and a messaging interface in the space my account to
              to chat with other parkour participants.
            </li>

          <h2>Biases on the test</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, from our point of view, the users had a too precise
            instruction to allow us to observe a real user experience. It
            would be interesting to do other tests without precise
            instructions.

        <h1><span>What I would do differently</span></h1>
        <p>
          This project is one year old now and since then with my apprentiship
          and side courses and readings I have improve my skills in
          accessibility concerning colours, spacing, size as well as universal
          design, inclusive design, and equity-focused design. For instance, I
          would surely add audio description and change CTA's colours, the
          black on blue first. Also, I think it would have been interesting to
          test different user flows with users instead of one. Nevertheless I
          think the good points of this project are our long research on
          different mediums for the graphic charter and the research part on
          which we spent a lot of time.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h1><span>Lessons to be learned</span></h1>
        <p>
          While working on this project I was really suprised by the
          freerunners’ willingness to help us understand their values and way
          of doing things. <br /><br />
          Also, during this project, at first we thought that we were going to
          do a website for teenagers but after our research we found that it
          was more the parents that we wanted to convince. So it was an
          intresting way to be put in front of our own biases.

          Thanks to our instructor Xavier Drouaud, to Florian Butour for
          helping us on the UX / UI part and to Amandine Delord for
          introducing us to anthropology and of course thanks to the Traceur
          de Nantes for allowing us participate in a training with them. Also,
          thanks to the person who tested our prototypes and gave us feedback!
