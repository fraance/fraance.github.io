              The project was realized with <a>Léa Verron</a> and
              <a>Galadrel Buchou</a>. All three of us participated equally to

            <h1>The problem</h1>
            <p>
              TDN, “Traceur de Nantes” is a French club that proposes
              Freerunning courses and workshops to beginners as well as to
              confirmed practitioners. The objective of the club is to promote
              and spread the practice of this urban sport. As the club develops,
              the volume of its activities grows, the courses multiply and the
              audience is diversifying. So, we took this opportunity to work on
              a new visual identity and a redesign of the site to cope with
              those new challenges.
            </p>

          <div class="section">
            <h1>The solution</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We set off a sociological and anthropological research to
                understand Parkour's community and association in order to
                create the new website in accordance with its values, history,
                objectives and members.
              </li>
              <li>
                We experimented on various media and with different techniques
                to chose visual working axes to tend to a visual identity
                corresponding with the discipline's and association's values.
              </li>
              <li>
                We followed a methodical approach, user scenarios, site map,
                wireframe to create a functional prototype of the new website.
              </li>
              <li>
                We tested the website's prototype with an eye tracking system to
                make a test analysis in order to improve the interface.

            <h1>Understanding Parkour</h1>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
              We set up several methods of approaching the parkour domain. On
              the one hand we conducted research about parkour's history,
              social, legal and existential ecosystem. On the other hand we had
              exchanges with traceurs which allowed us to better understand the
              art, its own codes and values.
            </p>
            <h2>Parkour's Fact</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Where and why?</li>
              The course was born in the Parisian suburbs, more precisely in
              Evry, in the 1980s. It is the investment of public spaces, the
              reflection of the marginalization of the suburban populations.
              Parkour enthusiasts, through their practice, reclaim the entire
              urban space.
              <li>Who?</li>
              David Belle is acknowledged as the inventor of parkour and founded
              an original and official group of parkour practitioners called
              Yamakasi. One day when David Belle was on a film set, he showed
              his 'Speed Air Man' video to Hubert Koundé, who suggested to
              change the "c" of "parcours" to a "k" because it was more dynamic
              and stronger, and to remove the silent "s" for the same reason.
              Belle liked the idea and officially changed the name of his
              discipline to "parkour”.
              <li>What?</li>
              Parkour is an athletic training discipline, it promotes not only
              the discipline of the body, the value of training, the importance
              of a healthy lifestyle but also respect for the instructor and
              others.
            </ul>
            <h2>Analysis of the current / quantitative data</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If we estimate the total French community at about 2,000-2,500
                practitioners, parkour although constantly increasing, remains a
                niche sport.
              </li>
              <li>
                Parkour is still practiced today by an essentially male public,
                since 85% of French practitioners are men according to the
                French Parkour Federation in 2018.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most of the practitioners are teenagers and young adults, mostly
                aged between 15 and 25, with a few in their 40s.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Qualitative data</h2>
            <p>
              We met up with traceurs and were able to participate in a training
              session and interact with them, it allowed us to get spontaneous
              answers to our questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also sent e-mails to a large number of parkour associations and
              had the opportunity to discuss with one of the leaders of the
              freestreet parkour association by phone which allowed us to
              understand the main characteristics of the discipline, as well as
              quantitative data, number of members, age, range, share of men and
              women of each association.
            </p>
            <p>I selected quetions that we asked frequently:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>“What are the values of Parkour according to you?”</li>
              <li>“Can you describe a typical training?”</li>
              <li>“Why do new members start parkour?”</li>
              <li>“What are the prejudices you are confronted with?”</li>
              <li>“How many participants do you have in your association?”</li>
              <li>
                “What is the proportion of men and women practicing parkour in
                your club?”
              </li>
              <li>“What are the most popular places for a parkour session?”</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What we learned</h2>
            <p>
              Our research enabled us to confirm the values that we had
              identified, which are the following: knowledge and surpassing
              oneself, solidarity, adaptability to the environment,
              open-mindedness, curiosity and creativity. Parkour is a practice
              with few constraints because parkoures have a flexible schedule
              and the places of expression are multiple. It is recognized as a
              physical activity and not as a sport in France and the authorities
              are rather tolerant when it comes to the public domain because of
              the free appropriation of urban spaces.
