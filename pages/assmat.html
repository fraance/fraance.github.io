          The aim is to facilitate contact between childminders and parents for

          <h1><span>My role</span></h1>
          <p>
            I worked on the project from begining to end. I was in charge of the
            research, the design explorations, the elaboration of the design
            system and prototypes but also the facilitation of communication
            within the team. I worked with 2 other students,
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/l%C3%A9a-veron-3a452020b/"
              >Léa Veron</a

            and

              >Mariya Panshak</a
            >. Léa and I worked more on UX and research while Mariya got more
            involved in the graphical part.

        <div class="section">
          <h1><span>The problem</span></h1>
          <p>
            First of all, what's an “assistante maternelle” in short “assmat”
            (childminder in English) ? It's an employee of private or public
            establishment or an individual, working in the care of children for
            all or part of the day, at their home (in general).
            <br /><br />
            In France, 30% of parents ideally want a childminder, but it can be
            really hard for them to find one because demand is extremely high
            compared to the offer.
            <br /><br />
            The Pays de la Loire region has therefore decided to make a call for
            tender to improve accessibility for the parents on the region's
            childminder website and the matching between parents and
            childminders. It also allows each childminder to present themselves
            on professional criterion. And finally, to portray an image that
            highlights the region uniqueness.
            <br /><br />
            It is in this context that we worked on a real tender but we didn't
            actually propose our solution.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h1><span>The solution</span></h1>
          <p>
            We focused on hyper-reactivity and rapidity by creating features
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Allowing two parents of the same family to connect at the same
              time enabling them to reply faster to offers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding the possibility to set an alarm in case a childminder
              corresponding to parents criterion puts an offer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating the possibility for parents to make a post describing
              their needs, reversing roles and allowing childminders to choose
              with who they want to work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a graphical charter with vibrant tones and putting extra
              focus on accessibility and clarity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our goal was to help childminders and parents establish contact and
            make the research of a childminder fast and even enjoyable. In order
            to achieve this, the plan was to create a delightful, visual, simple
            solution.
          </p>

            <h2>Quantitative research</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A child spends an average of 37 hours per week with a
                childminder.
              </li>
              <li>
                Two-earner families rely more on a childminder: 45% use this
                method of care compared to 19% of couples where only one member
                works.
              </li>
              <li>
                Almost 50% of families with care needs after 19:00 and before
                8:00 choose individual care more often.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is mostly mothers from intermediate or even high professional
                social categories who rely on a childminder.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="subsection">
            <h2>Qualitative research</h2>
            <p>
              First and foremost, we started by understanding how childminders
              work. Professionals require regional accreditation to be included
              in the region' official childminder list. This approval guarantees
              reliability and safety in terms of their ability.
            </p>
            <p>
              We sent a survey to a person working in an early childhood
              association in the Vendée region in order to look closer at how
              the research happens. After that we created a 10 questions Google
              Form and shared it in some Facebook groups and online forums
              dedicated to finding an childminder in order to try to understand
              the parents' problems. We gathered 62 answers which permitted us
              to highlight important fears and needs. Here the most important
              ones:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Expectations, parents are looking for someone who will be able
                to meet their educational expectations (For example, speaking
                English).
              </li>
              <li>
                Time, the childminder who meets their needs in terms of
                reception hours and who lives close to their homes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Price, a childminder who has more flexibility and is cheaper.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This helped us highlight user cases and identify the main user
              pain points to move forward in the project. For example this gave
              us insights in terms of search filters.

        <div class="section">
          <h1><span>Personas</span></h1>
          <p>
            Many different persons are looking for a child minder but with our
            previous research we were able to establish recurrent profiles,
            goals and frustrations.

          <p>
            We conducted a competitive analysis to discover what is the current
            state of childminder websites, regional websites, key points to work
            on and features that we found interesting to propose and the best
            solution at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helped us to establish some guiding principles and allowed us
            to get inspired for the graphical charter.

            After that, we chose colours, typography, icons in order to be
            accessible and enjoyable, worked on the logo and pictogrammes. And
            then we made a design system on Figma with styles and components.
